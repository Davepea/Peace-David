        I&apos;m a software engineer with an obsession for design. While I write clean, scalable code,
        my heart beats for how a site looks and feels. Over time, my friends and colleagues started
        calling me a &quot;Creative Developer&quot; â€” and it stuck. Now, I proudly blend engineering with aesthetics
        to create websites that truly represent the people behind them.
